* Pick Image from Google Drive
* Capture Camera Image
* Crop Image(Crop image based on provided aspect ratio or let user choose one)
* Compress Image(Compress image based on provided resolution and size)
* Retrive Image Result as File, File Path as String or Uri object
* Handle Runtime Permission for Camera and Storage

## üíªUsage


1. Gradle dependency:

	```groovy
	allprojects {
	   repositories {
	      	jcenter() // For ImagePicker library, this lien is enough. Although, it has been published on jitpack as well
           	maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }  //Make sure to add this in your project for uCrop - an internal library
	   }
	}
	```

    ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.Drjacky:ImagePicker:$libVersion'
    ```
    Where [![libVersion](https://img.shields.io/github/release/drjacky/imagePicker/all.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/drjacky/ImagePicker/releases)

    **If you want to get the activity result inline in a modern way (lambda) install [InlineActivityResult](https://github.com/florent37/InlineActivityResult) library:**
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.github.florent37:inline-activity-result-kotlin:1.0.4'
    ```
    
2.  <span style="color:red">**If you target Android 10 or higher(targetSdkVersion >= 29)**</span>, set the value of ``requestLegacyExternalStorage`` to true in your app's manifest file:

      ```xml
    <manifest ... >
          <!-- This attribute is "false" by default on apps targeting
               Android 10 or higher. -->
          <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ... >
            ...
          </application>
    </manifest>
      ```

3. The ImagePicker configuration is created using the builder pattern.

	**Kotlin**
    
	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
	        .cropOval()				//Allow dimmed layer to have a circle inside
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```
    
    **Java**
    
    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.Companion.with(this)
            .crop()	    			//Crop image(Optional), Check Customization for more option
	        .cropOval()				//Allow dimmed layer to have a circle inside
            .compress(1024)			//Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)	//Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start()
    ```
    
4. Handling results

    
    **Default method(Preferred way)**<br>
    Override `onActivityResult` method and handle ImagePicker result.

    ```kotlin
    override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
         super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
         if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
             //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
             val fileUri = data?.data
             imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
          
            //You can get File object from intent
            val file:File = ImagePicker.getFile(data)!!
           
            //You can also get File Path from intent
            val filePath:String = ImagePicker.getFilePath(data)!!
         } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
             Toast.makeText(this, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         } else {
             Toast.makeText(this, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
         }
    }
    ```

    **Inline method (with InlineActivityResult library, Only Works with FragmentActivity and AppCompatActivity) (Not to be used with crop. See [#32](https://github.com/Dhaval2404/ImagePicker/issues/32))**
    
    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
            .compress(1024)         //Final image size will be less than 1 MB(Optional)
            .maxResultSize(1080, 1080)  //Final image resolution will be less than 1080 x 1080(Optional)
            .start { resultCode, data ->
                if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                    //Image Uri will not be null for RESULT_OK
                     val fileUri = data?.data
                     imgProfile.setImageURI(fileUri)
                  
                    //You can get File object from intent
                    val file:File = ImagePicker.getFile(data)
                   
                    //You can also get File Path from intent
                    val filePath:String = ImagePicker.getFilePath(data)
                } else if (resultCode == ImagePicker.RESULT_ERROR) {
                    Toast.makeText(context, ImagePicker.getError(data), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                } else {
                    Toast.makeText(context, "Task Cancelled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                }
            }
    ```

## üé®Customization

 *  Pick image using Gallery

	```kotlin
	ImagePicker.with(this)
		.galleryOnly()	//User can only select image from Gallery
		.start()	//Default Request Code is ImagePicker.REQUEST_CODE
    ```

 *  Capture image using Camera

	```kotlin
	ImagePicker.with(this)
		.cameraOnly()	//User can only capture image using Camera
		.start()
    ```
 *  Crop image
 		
    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.crop()	    //Crop image and let user choose aspect ratio.
		.start()
	```
 *  Crop image with fixed Aspect Ratio

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.crop(16f, 9f)	//Crop image with 16:9 aspect ratio
		.start()
    ```
 *  Crop square image(e.g for profile)

     ```kotlin
     ImagePicker.with(this)
         .cropSquare()	//Crop square image, its same as crop(1f, 1f)
         .start()
    ```
 *  Compress image size(e.g image should be maximum 1 MB)

	```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.compress(1024)	//Final image size will be less than 1 MB
		.start()
    ```
 *  Set Resize image resolution

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.maxResultSize(620, 620)	//Final image resolution will be less than 620 x 620
		.start()
    ```
 *  Intercept ImageProvider, Can be used for analytics

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
        .setImageProviderInterceptor { imageProvider -> //Intercept ImageProvider
            Log.d("ImagePicker", "Selected ImageProvider: "+imageProvider.name)
        }
        .start()
    ```

 *  Specify Directory to store captured, cropped or compressed images

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
        //Provide directory path to save images
        .saveDir(File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "ImagePicker"))
        // .saveDir(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory())
        // .saveDir(getExternalFilesDir(null)!!)
        .start()
    ```

 *  Limit MIME types while choosing a gallery image

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
        .galleryMimeTypes(  //Exclude gif images
            mimeTypes = arrayOf(
              "image/png",
              "image/jpg",
              "image/jpeg"
            )
          )
        .start()
    ```

 *  You can also specify the request code with ImagePicker

    ```kotlin
    ImagePicker.with(this)
		.maxResultSize(620, 620)
		.start(101)	//Here 101 is request code, you may use this in onActivityResult
    ```

 *  Add Following parameters in your **colors.xml** file, If you want to customize uCrop Activity.

    ```xml
    <resources>
        <!-- Here you can add color of your choice  -->
        <color name="ucrop_color_toolbar">@color/teal_500</color>
